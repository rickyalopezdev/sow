Would you like to start with Phase 1? I can help you set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and shadcn/ui. We can then work through each phase systematically, ensuring we have a solid foundation before moving to more complex features.
Let me know if you'd like to proceed with Phase 1, or if you'd prefer to adjust the plan in any way.
